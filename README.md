This repo describes [cute](./docs/practice/cuteness.md) [patterns](./docs/knowledge/pattern.md) to successfully work and get stuff done in the context of the projects of [me](https://mkbrechtel.dev), my team at the IDMKD and other projects. ✨

## Content 🗃️

All patterns are documented as markdown files in the [`docs/`-directory](./docs/) organized by category folders. Browse them directly on GitHub or view the rendered documentation site for a more polished experience as soon as it is released.
