# üåê Host Traefik Pattern

Host-based Traefik pattern provides centralized HTTPS termination and routing for services on a single host without requiring Docker socket access.

## Key Components

- Shared Docker proxy network for service connectivity
- File-based configuration in /srv/traefik/conf.d/
- Per-service configuration files
- Automatic Let's Encrypt certificate management
- HTTP to HTTPS redirection

## Directory Structure

```bash
/srv/traefik/#
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yaml     # Traefik compose configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ traefik.yaml           # Main Traefik configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ conf.d/                # Service configurations
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ service.yaml       # Per-service routing rules
```

## Usage

1. Create the proxy network:
```bash
docker network create proxy
```

2. Add service to proxy network in compose.yml:
```yaml
networks:
  proxy:
    external: true
```

3. Configure routing in /srv/traefik/conf.d/service.yaml:
```yaml
http:
  routers:
    myservice:
      entrypoints: websecure
      rule: Host(`service.domain.com`)
      service: myservice
  services:
    myservice:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: http://container_name:port
```

## Security Features

- No Docker socket access required
- File-based configuration
- Automatic HTTPS
- Network isolation via proxy network
- TLS certificate management
